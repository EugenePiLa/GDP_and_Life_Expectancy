# Life Expectancy and GDP of Six Countries: Is There Any Correlation?

This project aims to explore, examine, and analyze the correlation between life expectancy and GDP across six countries over a span of 16 years. The dataset includes information about life expectancy at birth and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of six countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the evolution of life expectancy over time in these six countries.
- Explore the evolution of GDP over the same period.
- Investigate if there is any correlation between the two variables (life expectancy and GDP).

# Data Limitations
Before proceeding with the analysis, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of only one source of data.
- It covers only 6 countries, which may not be representative of a broader global trend.
- The dataset does not include data from the last 10 years.
- These limitations mean that while the project will explore the available data and produce visualizations, any meaningful conclusions or generalizations would require additional research and more comprehensive datasets.

# What Youâ€™ll Find in This Project
Data Exploration: Initial inspection and description of the dataset.
Visualizations: Various plots and charts to understand the evolution of life expectancy and GDP over time.
Correlation Analysis: An exploration of how life expectancy and GDP relate to each other.
Conclusions: Insights based on the data analysis and a discussion of any findings or trends.


This project serves as a starting point to understand the relationship between life expectancy and GDP over time. It provides an opportunity to dive into data visualization and analysis, while also recognizing the need for more data and research to draw strong conclusions.

Feel free to explore the visualizations and findings, and consider this an introduction to the exploration of how economic factors might influence public health.
